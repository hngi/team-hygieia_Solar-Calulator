            <p>This is a simple solar energy calculator made by Team-Hygieia.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>This app helps users to calculate the total amount of power consumable by the user. These calculations are based
                on the types and quantities of the appliances the user selects. The different appliances have their specific
                power ratings, which we have collated and incorporated into this app. The only hard work required from the
                user is to select their various appliances, the quantity of each, and click on the
                <strong>Total Consumption</strong> button, The total power consumed in kilowatt is then displayed right underneath
                the button.</p>
            <p>Should you possess an appliance and such is not among the options selectable, kindly reach out to us through
                our technical head at gentilityisworthwhile@yahoo.com.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for using our app.</p>
